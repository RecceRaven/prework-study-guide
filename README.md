# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was made by a beginner coder to help understand the fundamentals of coding.
I built this project for reference through out my boot camp. This project solves the problem of having to search for information; instead it is neatly organized here. Through out this pre work, I learned everything you see in the index.html file, as I knew none of this prior to this course.




## Installation

## Usage

This project may be used by anyone who wishes to see what was learned during the pre work for the boot camp. One may also open the console to see javascript running, and for suggestions on what to learn first.
